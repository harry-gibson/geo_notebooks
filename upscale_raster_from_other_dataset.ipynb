    "# Upscaling one raster dataset based on another\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement of problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two raster timeseries datasets from different sources, nominally representing the same variable. One is at relatively high spatial resolution but is only annual in temporal resolution. The other is at coarse spatial resolution but is available at monthly (or finer) temporal resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to combine the information from these datasets to interpolate higher-resolution monthly data. We use the principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HiRes(y,m) = LowRes(y,m) * HiRes(y) / sum(LowRes(y,1)..LowRes(y,12))\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "    HiRes(y,m) = LowRes(y,m) * HiRes(y) / mean(LowRes(y,1)..LowRes(y,12))\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is taken from [this paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30047-6/fulltext#supplementaryMaterial) (Eq2 of the supplementary material). Here the \"low resolution\" data are PM<sub>2.5</sub> rasters derived from MERRA-2, and the \"high resolution\" data are PM<sub>2.5</sub> rasters obtained from [this site](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/martin/?page_id=140). We would like to create monthly PM<sub>2.5</sub> rasters at the spatial resolution (0.01 degrees) of the annual dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*However, the equation referenced uses the annual sum of the low-res data, but this seems to be wrong for a quantity such as PM2.5 where a mean is surely the correct approach. (The high-resolution annual data are not a \"sum\" of all the months, they are an annual average). Sum would be appropriate for e.g. precipitation.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic challenge is thus to overlay and perform an array-wise calculation between two rasters which are of different sizes (resolution and extent). We will use rasterio to create a virtual raster from the low resolution rasters, which is warped and reprojected to the same extent and resolution as the high resolution raster."
